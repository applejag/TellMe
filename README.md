# TellMe

Quiz "game show" game that allows you to ask your friends on what they know.

## Gameplay

- One of the players picks a category and difficulty.
- The host reveals the question.
- The first player to beep gets to answer.
- If they fail, the question is passed on to the next player to try answer it.
- If answered correctly, you gain points, based on difficulty.
- If answered incorrectly, you lose points, based on difficulty.
- Most points when no questions remain wins.
- Oh, and pretty much everything is on a time limit.
